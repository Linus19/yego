                <h1>Tax and Regulatory</h1>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Direct Taxes</h2>
                <p>Direct taxation in Kenya broadly refers to the Income Tax and Wealth tax laws which involve personal
                    tax, corporate tax, minimum alternate tax, capital gains tax, international tax and transfer
                    pricing.
                    We offer services in each of the above mentioned areas of tax and legal regulatory compliance.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Tax Strategy and Legal Compliance</h2>
                <p>Our endeavor is to formulate an ideal tax strategy for our clients which is compliant with the law,
                    legitimately reduces the tax bills and yet is not prone to invite litigation.
                    Our specialist tax partners have a responsibility to ensure that the clients tax bill is optimised
                    and they do not pay any unnecessary taxes. This involves a complete understanding of the ever
                    changing tax laws which offer innumerable tax optimisation opportunities in the form of deductions,
                    exemptions and claims for losses and expenses. Coupled with an intimate understanding of the clients
                    business and structure the potential tax strategies are formulated, discussed and finalised to
                    minimise the tax bills and having said so, we also recognise the fact that the tax strategy should
                    not be overly aggressive and should not increase clients tax risks so as to plunge them into
                    protracted litigation.
                    Our tax Specialists teams constantly monitor the development of legal jurisprudence, the statutory
                    pronouncements and the amendments in tax laws which invariably have far reaching consequences on the
                    clients’ tax strategies. Our knowledge plays a pivotal role in tax planning, advisory and compliance
                    services.
                    Our regulatory compliance services ensure that the clients attain a high level of stringent tax law
                    compliances.</p>
